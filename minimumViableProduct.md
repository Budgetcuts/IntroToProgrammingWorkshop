## Minimum Viable Product
According to Eric Reids, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is defined as "that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort".

**What?**

What does that definition really mean? The MVP is a version of the product with the least amount of functionality possible. Every project has a different MVP; some may just be a landing page, while others may be a working prototype. This explains the "least effort" aspect of the definition.

The users of the MVP will provide feedback, which is important to take into consideration. This is where the "maximum amount of validated learning" comes into play. Validated learning is trying a new idea on customers to "validate" the effect. 

**Why?**

The main purposes of an MVP are to gain information from the user and to conserve resources. The user feedback will tell you where to spend the most time making changes. Time is the most precious of your resources. It is not worth it to spend hours working on a functionality that users of the MVP will say to remove. Thus, you should start with the least functionality then build up from there. This is significantly less risky than releasing a finished product with no feedback.

**So?**

After receiving responses, you must make changes to the product. These improvements can be small or large. Don't be afraid to drastically change the product if that is what the feedback suggests. Unfortunately, you may even find that the market simply is not interested in your product. So sometimes completely scrapping the idea is the solution.
