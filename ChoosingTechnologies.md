# Researching and Choosing Technologies

When it comes time to start developing your project, you'll first need to decide what kind of technologies you're going to be using.

## Programming Languages

The first decision you'll need to make is what programming language to use. There are dozens of popular languages available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Here is a chart of some of the most common programming languages as well as their most common use cases:

| Language | Strengths | Common Uses |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Python   | Easy to learn, Access to community-built libraries | Web applications, Machine learning, Data retrieval and engineering|
| C/C++    | High performance, Low level control over memory | Resource intensive applications, Game engines, High-liability software (Medical, Military, etc.) |
| C# | Easier to use than C/C++ but less powerful | Game development |
| Java     | Encourages object oriented programming | Android app development |
| Javascript| Powerful frameworks for website functionality | Advanced website development, Web applications |
| HTML/CSS | Pixel-by-pixel control over webpage appearance | Front-End Website Development |
| R | Fast and easy statistical computations | Data science and visualization |
| Ruby | Quick web-app development with Ruby-On-Rails | Web Applications |
| Swift | Designed specifically for iOS | iOS App Development |


## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is quickly becoming one of the most powerful tools in all of computing. However, knowing **when** to use it is just as important as knowing **how**.

Machine Learning algorithms are very good at a few key tasks: making predictions, recognizing patterns, identifying important information, and classifying objects.

In order to ensure that an ML algorithm performs each of these tasks with the highest accuracy possible, a large pool of high quality data is required to 

Now that you know **when** to use ML, stop by our [Machine Learning Workshop](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M282YWprNzFwMXBvNDJqcWpubDFlaGdhaHNfMjAxOTEwMTZUMjIzMDAwWiBkaGFycGVyMUBiaW5naGFtdG9uLmVkdQ&tmsrc=dharper1%40binghamton.edu) on October 16th to learn about **how** to start using it in your projects.

## Databases

If you're going to be storing large amounts of data for your project, it's important to decide what type of database you're going to be using. There are 2 major types of databases: **SQL** and **NoSQL**

**SQL** stands for Structured Query Language. SQL databases use pre-defined schemas to determine their layout, making them more complicated to set up but much more organized overall. Data is placed into tables which can have relationships to other tables, allowing for connections to be made between similar data points like user IDs.

**NoSQL**, just like the name implies, does not use Structured Query Language. There are no structured tables or relationships between tables, there is just data placed freely into formats like columns, graphs, or key-value pairs. This makes NoSQL far easier to implement and a better choice for small, simple databases.
