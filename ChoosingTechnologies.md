# Researching and Choosing Technologies

When it comes time to start developing your project, you'll first need to decide what kind of technologies you're going to be using.

## Programming Languages

The first decision you'll need to make is what programming language to use. There are dozens of popular languages available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here is a chart of the most common programming languages as well as their most common use cases:

| Language | Strengths | Common Uses |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Python   | Easy to learn, Access to community-built libraries | Web applications, Machine learning, Data retrieval and engineering|
| C/C++    | High performance, Low level control over memory | Resource intensive applications, Game engines, High-liability software (Medical, Military, etc.) |
| C# | Easier to use than C/C++ but less powerful | Game development |
| Java     | Encourages object oriented programming | Android app development |
| Javascript| Powerful frameworks for website functionality | Advanced website development, Web applications |
| HTML/CSS | Pixel-by-pixel control over webpage appearance | Front-End Website Development |
| R | Fast and easy statistical computations | Data science and visualization |
| Ruby | Quick web-app development with Ruby-On-Rails | Web Applications |
| Swift | Designed specifically for iOS | iOS App Development |




## Databases

If you're going to be storing large amounts of data for your project, it's important to decide what type of database you're going to be using. There are 2 major types of databases: SQL and NoSQL

SQL Stands for Standard Query Language

NoSQL, just like the name implies, is the opposite of SQL. There are no structured tables or relationships between tables, there is just data in one
