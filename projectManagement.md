# Project Management

Project management is a key part of undertaking any tech project. It helps you learn from your mistakes and make progress in the future. Even in the context of a personal project, which might have a team as small as 1-4 people, keeping these principles in mind can be helpful to improve both the quality of your work and the enjoyment of your workflow.

In this section, we'll discuss a few aspects of project management, all of which tie into *Agile*. Agile is a highly effective method of developing software from which every team and individual can learn.

**Cost Estimation**

Cost estimation is the skill of managing your budget. This "budget" refers to a number of things - your financial budget of course, but you can view other resources like time, people, and skills as resources as a budget you need to keep track of as well. Estimating how costly an endeavor will be allows you to plan and, when working with others, delegate appropriately.

Estimating costs should not be considered a separate task that's completed once and then filed away. Instead, it's an integrative process involving every member of the team (including the tech and business sides) that continues to occur as more specifications are added to the product and more roadblocks come in your way. Estimating costs iteratively allows you to take in account new risk and opportunity as they arise, creating a more successful product.

**Establishing a Time Frame**

Establishing a time frame is important to planning a personal project. As busy college students, it can be challenging to balance working consistently on a personal project with the demands of classes, work, and clubs, so establishing a time frame helps you deliver on your plans.

First, you want to make sure you understand the project scope. This is something where you'll use cost estimation.

**Agile**

Agile methodologies are a style of software project management that emphasizes flexibility, prioritizing people over processes, and, most importantly, iterative development.

Agile works for software development in particular because of how project specifications can change at a moment's notice, how quickly the technological landscape changes, and how many moving parts there tend to be in every large software project. In fact, it's been proven to increase efficiency and productivity!

Work is divided into cycles called "sprints" where every member of the team has certain user stories (essentially tasks) to complete in that sprint. At the end of each sprint, the team re-evaluates and decides what stories to tackle next, taking in account customer feedback and changing needs of the project.

This style of work is designed for teams of 5-10 people, but can be implemented with any team or even solo! It's all about the dedication to continuous improvement and willingness to be flexible.

A key principle of Agile is *kaizen* which is a Japanese word that means "continuous improvement". It's a philosophy that is a part of iterative development -- all about focusing on activities that add value and not wasting precious resources on activities that do not.

There are a number of productivity tools designed with Agile development in mind. Some of the most popular are JIRA, Trello, and Monday. They all include the feature of boards where user stories are staged, rather than a typical to-do list. This allows you get a birds-eye view of the project and assign different tasks to different people appropriately. We use Trello for keeping track of HackBU tasks, and it's helped us stay on track!
