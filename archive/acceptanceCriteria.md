## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria (AC) is a set of pre-established standards that a project must meet to satisfy its users. The AC should define the end goals; furthermore, it defines when the project is done. This is important so that nothing is forgotten in the process and there is no ambiguity in the design.

**When to create the AC**
The AC should be established before development begins. At this point, the AC will be written focusing on the end goals. If the AC is written after development begins, it is likely that you will write the criteria based off how your program currently functions.

**How to create the AC**
The AC should define what you want the program to do. The criteria should only focus on the "what" not the "how", so implementation does not need to be included.

Each part of the AC should be written as a pass/fail statement that can easily be translated into at least one test case. Each statement should be a clear, concise goal. The goals should be written in simple terms; anyone reading them should be able to understand what you want.

One format for writing criteria is given/when/then statements. Given a certain condition, when I perform this action, then this should occur. The given conditions ("given") can include who the user is or what functions they have already performed (ex. the user selected three emails). The action performed ("when") could be clicking a button (ex. when the user clicks a sort button). What occurs ("then") should be the result of the action (ex. emails get sorted by date).

**Now what?**
You have created your AC - now what? The AC can be used to generate test cases for your program. Writing each statement in the AC as pass/fail makes this transition to testing easier. Refer back to the AC often and ensure it stays updated. As you come up with more ideas for functions, add them to the AC. Your AC will eventually tell you when you have accomplished everything you wanted, which means you are done!
